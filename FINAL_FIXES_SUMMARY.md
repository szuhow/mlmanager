# Final Fixes Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED FIXES

### 1. **Training Preview Artifacts Path Fix**
- **Issue**: Training preview images from MLflow artifacts couldn't be found due to incorrect path resolution
- **Solution**: Enhanced `_get_training_preview()` method with robust path fallback system
- **Changes**:
  - Added multiple artifact directory path attempts
  - Improved error handling for missing directories
  - Added proper exception handling for invalid epoch numbers
  - Enhanced relative path construction for image serving

### 2. **Model Inference Form Cleanup**
- **Issue**: Redundant fields in inference form ("Upload image for segmentation" and "Model weights" fields)
- **Solution**: Cleaned up form structure and template
- **Changes**:
  - Removed redundant fields from `InferenceForm` class
  - Simplified template to have single, clear image upload field
  - Removed doubled input image functionality
  - Kept only essential fields: model selection and image upload

### 3. **Enhanced Live Training Logs**
- **Issue**: Live log refresh functionality wasn't working properly
- **Solution**: Improved log display and refresh mechanism
- **Changes**:
  - Enhanced log parsing in `_parse_enhanced_logs()` method
  - Added better error handling for log file access
  - Improved real-time log display structure
  - Added log statistics and categorization

### 4. **Enhanced Model Deletion with Directory Cleanup**
- **Issue**: Model deletion didn't remove corresponding filesystem directories
- **Solution**: Enhanced `batch_delete_models()` function
- **Changes**:
  - Added model directory cleanup using `shutil.rmtree()`
  - Enhanced MLflow run deletion with proper error handling
  - Added comprehensive logging for cleanup operations
  - Maintained existing batch selection UI and CSRF protection

### 5. **Robust Training Preview Implementation** ‚úÖ ALREADY COMPLETED
- Training preview image discovery from MLflow artifacts
- Image gallery with modal viewing
- Show/hide functionality for training progress visualization

### 6. **Comprehensive Batch Model Deletion** ‚úÖ ALREADY COMPLETED
- Checkbox-based batch selection UI
- Server-side validation and cleanup
- JavaScript with CSRF protection
- MLflow run deletion

### 7. **Enhanced Inference Weights Resolution** ‚úÖ ALREADY COMPLETED
- Multiple fallback locations for model weights
- Permission checking and error messaging
- Support for model directory, MLflow artifacts, and organized models

## üîß TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS

# Pull Request: Fix Channel Mismatch and Enhance Model Architecture Registry

## 🎯 Summary

This PR resolves critical channel mismatch issues between training and inference pipelines, and significantly enhances the model architecture registry to provide comprehensive ResUNet model variants.

## 🔧 Problem Statement

### Channel Mismatch Issue
- **Training models** expected RGB input (3 channels)
- **Inference models** were created with grayscale input (1 channel)
- This caused inference failures and inconsistent behavior
- Models couldn't load checkpoints due to architecture mismatch

### Limited Model Selection
- Django forms only showed "U-Net (default)" option
- ResUNet variants were implemented but not available in UI
- Users couldn't select advanced architectures like attention mechanisms

## ✅ Changes Made

### 🔧 Channel Mismatch Fix
- **`ml/inference/predict.py`**: Updated `load_model()` to create models with `n_channels=3`
- **`ml/inference/predict.py`**: Fixed inference transforms to preserve RGB format
- **`ml/training/train.py`**: Updated `run_inference()` to force 3 channels for RGB input
- **`ml/training/models/resunet_model.py`**: Fixed import handling for dynamic loading

### 🚀 Enhanced Model Architecture Registry
- **`ml/utils/architecture_registry.py`**: Complete overhaul with comprehensive ResUNet variants
- **Fixed import paths**: Corrected to locate models in `ml/training/models/`
- **Added 7 ResUNet variants**: Standard, Deep, Attention variants with convenience functions
- **Updated default configs**: All models now default to 3 channels (RGB input)

## 📋 Available Model Types (Before → After)

### Before
- U-Net (Default) ❌ *Only option*

### After  
- MONAI U-Net ✅ *Medical imaging framework*
- U-Net (Default) ✅ *MONAI implementation*
- **Residual U-Net** ✅ *Improved gradient flow*
- **Deep Residual U-Net** ✅ *Complex feature extraction*
- **Residual U-Net with Attention** ✅ *Better feature selection*
- **Deep Residual U-Net with Attention** ✅ *Advanced localization*
- **Create Residual U-Net (Function)** ✅ *Convenience function*
- **Create Deep Residual U-Net (Function)** ✅ *Convenience function*
- **Create Attention Residual U-Net (Function)** ✅ *Convenience function*

## 🧪 Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suites Added
- **`tests/test_channel_fix.py`**: Verifies channel compatibility (4/4 tests pass)
- **`tests/test_enhanced_registry.py`**: Tests architecture registry (all tests pass)

### Test Results
```
Channel Mismatch Fix: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED
- Model Creation: ✅ 3-channel RGB models created successfully  
- Forward Pass: ✅ RGB input compatibility confirmed
- Inference Transforms: ✅ RGB format preserved
- Inference Script: ✅ Correct model structure

Enhanced Registry: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED
- Architecture Registry: ✅ 9 models registered (up from 2)
- Django Forms Integration: ✅ All variants available in dropdowns
- Model Instantiation: ✅ 4/4 main models successfully instantiated
```

## 📈 Impact

### User Benefits
- **Resolved training-inference compatibility** - Models can now load checkpoints properly
- **Expanded architecture choices** - Users can select from 9 different model variants
- **Better model flexibility** - From simple U-Net to sophisticated ResUNet with attention
- **Improved medical imaging support** - RGB input handling for real-world images

### Technical Benefits
- **Consistent channel handling** across training and inference
- **Robust import system** with fallback mechanisms
- **Extensible architecture registry** for future model additions
- **Comprehensive test coverage** for reliability

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### For Existing Users
- **No breaking changes** to existing workflows
- **Automatic backward compatibility** maintained
- **Enhanced UI** with more model options
- **Improved inference reliability**

### For Developers
- **Architecture registry** is now easily extensible
- **Proper import handling** for dynamic model loading
- **Test suites** available for validation
- **Clear separation** between model registration and instantiation

## 🚀 Next Steps

After merging this PR:
1. **Test with real training workflows** to validate end-to-end compatibility
2. **Add more model architectures** using the enhanced registry system
3. **Optimize attention mechanisms** for bilinear upsampling (minor issue noted in tests)
4. **Add model documentation** for each architecture variant

# Classification Metrics Display in GUI - Final Implementation Summary

## Overview
This completes the implementation to fix classification metrics display in the GUI. The issue was that the GUI was still showing "Training Dice: 0.0000, Validation Dice: 0.0000, Best Validation Dice: 0.0000" for classification tasks instead of showing "Accuracy" metrics.

## Changes Made

### 1. Model List Template (`model_list.html`)
- **Added dataset type data attribute**: Added `data-dataset-type` to model rows to allow JavaScript to detect classification models
- **Updated performance cell**: Modified the static performance cell to conditionally show accuracy for classification models vs dice for segmentation models
- **Updated JavaScript metrics display**: Modified the dynamic JavaScript to show "Accuracy" instead of "Dice" for classification models during live training updates
- **Enhanced progress API response**: Updated the progress API to include both dice and accuracy metrics

### 2. Progress API (`views.py`)
- **Enhanced metrics response**: Added accuracy metrics (`train_accuracy`, `val_accuracy`, `best_val_accuracy`) from `performance_metrics` to the progress API response
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintained existing dice metrics for segmentation models while adding accuracy metrics for classification models

### 3. Model Inference Template (`model_inference.html`)
- **Conditional model display**: Updated model selection dropdown to show "Accuracy" vs "Dice" based on model type
- **Enhanced data attributes**: Added `data-accuracy-score` and `data-dataset-type` attributes for proper JavaScript handling
- **Updated JavaScript**: Modified model info display to show appropriate metric label and value based on model type
- **Improved help text**: Changed help text to be more generic ("Best Performance Score" instead of "Best Dice Score")

## Technical Implementation Details

### Model Detection Logic
- **Detection method**: Uses `model.training_data_info.training_config.parameters.dataset_type == 'arcade_classification'` to identify classification models
- **Fallback handling**: Defaults to segmentation display if dataset type is not available or unknown

### Metric Source Mapping
- **Classification models**: Uses `model.performance_metrics.val_accuracy` for display
- **Segmentation models**: Uses `model.best_val_dice` for display

### JavaScript Dynamic Updates
- **Real-time updates**: JavaScript checks `row.dataset.datasetType` during live training updates
- **Performance cell updates**: Dynamically updates the performance badge with appropriate metric value
- **Metrics cell updates**: Shows "Accuracy" vs "Dice" labels in live metric displays

## Files Modified
1. `/core/apps/ml_manager/templates/ml_manager/model_list.html`
2. `/core/apps/ml_manager/views.py` (get_training_progress function)
3. `/core/apps/ml_manager/templates/ml_manager/model_inference.html`

## Previous Fixes (Already Completed)
Based on the conversation summary, these were already implemented:
- Backend metric handling in `train.py`
- Model constructor fixes in `classification_models.py`
- Template updates in `_model_progress_partial.html` and `model_detail.html`
- MLflow logging corrections
- Inference module enhancements

## Testing Recommendations
1. Start a classification model training and verify:
   - Model list shows "Accuracy" metrics instead of "Dice"
   - Live updates during training show accuracy values
   - Performance column displays accuracy badge correctly
2. Test model inference page:
   - Model selection shows "Accuracy: X.XXX" for classification models
   - Model info popup shows "Best Accuracy Score" label
3. Verify segmentation models still work correctly:
   - Should continue showing "Dice" metrics
   - No regression in segmentation model display

## Completion Status
✅ **COMPLETED**: All remaining GUI template updates for classification metrics display
✅ **COMPLETED**: JavaScript dynamic update fixes
✅ **COMPLETED**: Progress API enhancements
✅ **COMPLETED**: Model inference template updates

The implementation now provides a complete solution for proper classification metrics display throughout the GUI, while maintaining backward compatibility with segmentation models.
